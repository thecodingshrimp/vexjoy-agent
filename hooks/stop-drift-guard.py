Stop-event drift guard (ADR: adr/stop-event-drift-guards.md)

Advisory Stop hook that catches three classes of self-inflicted toolkit
regression the moment they're introduced — at Stop, not at CI. It computes the
session's working-tree diff, decides which component classes changed, runs ONLY
the relevant existing check script, and re-wakes the session ADVISORY- only (it
never blocks) when a check actually REPORTS drift.

Relevance gate (diff file paths -> which check to run):
  - hooks/** changed                          -> smoke-test-hooks.py --ci
  - a component file ADDED/REMOVED under
    hooks/|skills/|agents/|scripts/, OR a
    count-claim doc touched (README.md,
    CLAUDE.md, docs/**)                        -> validate-doc-counts.py --json
  - skills/** or agents/** frontmatter changed -> check-routing-drift.py

Only checks whose component class actually changed run, and a check surfaces
output ONLY when it REPORTS drift — a clean session stays silent.

Correctness properties (this is security-adjacent self-improvement infra):
  - NEVER blocks. Drift surfaces via hook_utils.async_rewake (exit 2 +
    rewakeSummary on stdout, context on stderr). There is no
    permissionDecision:deny path anywhere in this hook.
  - Fail-open. ANY internal error -> exit 0, skip. A crashed guard never stalls
    a session.
  - Dedup. A byte-identical working-tree diff short-circuits via
    hook_utils.DiffDedup with its own state dir, so an unchanged diff doesn't
    re-nag across consecutive Stop events.
  - Recursion guard. stop_hook_active (CC sets it while a rewake is in flight)
    short-circuits so the rewake itself can't loop.

Kill switch:
  - VEXJOY_DRIFT_GUARD_DISABLE=1  disables the hook entirely (and ONLY "1";
    "0" / anything else does not disable).

The hook owns no detection logic of its own — it delegates to the three existing
scripts (scripts/smoke-test-hooks.py, scripts/validate-doc-counts.py,
scripts/check-routing-drift.py). A script that errors or can't run is treated as
"no drift" (fail-open), never as drift.

Module seams (patched by hooks/tests/test_stop_drift_guard.py):
  - read_stdin(timeout=...)         (imported from stdin_timeout)
  - _working_tree_diff(cwd) -> str  (thin wrapper over hook_utils.working_tree_diff)
  - _has_reviewable_content(diff)   (front gate; True if the diff has any signal)
  - _run_check(name, cwd) -> {"drift": bool, "detail": str, "fix": str}
                                     | {"drift": False} | None
  - _STATE_DIR, _STATE_FILE         (Path constants for DiffDedup)
  - main()                          (stdin -> dispatch on hook_event_name == "Stop")

# PR Workflow Skill

Umbrella skill for the entire pull request lifecycle. Routes to the correct reference based on the PR task requested.

## Routing

Detect the user's intent and load the appropriate reference file:

| Intent | Trigger phrases | Reference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Sync** (default) | "push", "create PR", "sync", "ship this" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync.md` |
| **Pipeline** | "submit PR", "full PR", "end-to-end PR", "open PR" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/pipeline.md` |
| **Fix** | "fix PR comments", "address review", "pr-fix", "resolve feedback" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/fix.md` |
| **Status** | "pr status", "branch status", "is my PR ready", "check CI" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/status.md` |
| **Cleanup** | "clean up branches", "delete merged branch", "prune" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/cleanup.md` |
| **Feedback** | "process PR feedback", "address reviews", "what did reviewers say" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/feedback.md` |
| **Miner** | "mine PRs", "extract review comments", "tribal knowledge", "reviewer patterns" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/miner.md` |
| **Branch name** | "generate branch name", "validate branch name", "name branch", "branch convention", "git branch name" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/branch-name.md` |
| **CI check** | "check CI", "CI status", "actions status", "did CI pass", "build status", "CI passed" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/ci-check.md` |
| **Commit** | "commit changes", "stage and commit", "commit my changes", "commit my files", "commit these" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/commit.md` |
| **Codex review** | "codex review", "second opinion", "code review codex", "gpt review", "cross-model review" | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/codex-review.md` |

**Default action**: When invoked with no arguments or ambiguous intent, load `sync.md` (the most common PR use case).

## Reference Loading Table

| Signal | Load These Files | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "push", "create PR", "sync", "ship this" | `sync.md` | **Sync** (default) |
| "submit PR", "full PR", "end-to-end PR", "open PR" | `pipeline.md` | **Pipeline** |
| "fix PR comments", "address review", "pr-fix", "resolve feedback" | `fix.md` | **Fix** |
| "pr status", "branch status", "is my PR ready", "check CI" | `status.md` | **Status** |
| "clean up branches", "delete merged branch", "prune" | `cleanup.md` | **Cleanup** |
| "process PR feedback", "address reviews", "what did reviewers say" | `feedback.md` | **Feedback** |
| "mine PRs", "extract review comments", "tribal knowledge", "reviewer patterns" | `miner.md` | **Miner** |
| "generate branch name", "validate branch name", "name branch", "branch convention", "git branch name" | `branch-name.md` | **Branch name** |
| "check CI", "CI status", "actions status", "did CI pass", "build status", "CI passed" | `ci-check.md` | **CI check** |
| "commit changes", "stage and commit", "commit my changes", "commit my files", "commit these" | `commit.md` | **Commit** |
| "codex review", "second opinion", "code review codex", "gpt review", "cross-model review" | `codex-review.md` | **Codex review** |

## Mandatory PR Body Structure

`gh pr create --body "..."` is how every agent in this toolkit opens PRs, and it **bypasses `.github/pull_request_template.md` entirely** — GitHub only applies that file to the web UI and to a bare `gh pr create` with no `--body`. So the structure must be reproduced in the `--body` string by hand.

Every agent-authored PR body MUST follow the same five sections as `.github/pull_request_template.md`, in this order: **Summary → Changes → Testing → Scope & Risk → Checklist**. This keeps PR bodies consistent across models (Opus, Sonnet, and every other harness produce the same shape).

The **Testing** section requires pasted command output (ruff exit, pytest counts, gate traces, dogfood output), never the bare claim "tests pass" — this ties to `verification-before-completion`: evidence, not assertion.

Copy this canonical skeleton into `--body`:

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- 1-3 sentences: what changed and why. Name the ADR/issue if any. -->

## Changes
- `path/to/file` — what changed

## Testing
<!-- Paste command + result. Evidence, not "tests pass". -->
\`\`\`
$ <command>
<pasted output: counts / exit code / trace>
\`\`\`

## Scope & Risk
- **Touches:** <limb / area>
- **NOT touched:** <files/limbs deliberately left alone>
- **Rollback:** <revert the commit; any state notes>

## Checklist
- [ ] ruff check + format clean (excl `venv.312.bak`) — if any `.py` touched
- [ ] pytest green (counts pasted above)
- [ ] `validate-doc-counts.py` → 0 drift
- [ ] conformance gate passes — if any workflow `.js` touched
- [ ] No forbidden files staged
```

The sync (`sync.md` Step 5) and pipeline (`pipeline.md` Phase 5) references carry this same skeleton at their `gh pr create` call sites. When either path writes a `--body`, it uses this structure.

## Instructions

1. Identify the user's PR task from their message
2. Load the matching reference file from the table above
3. Follow the instructions in that reference file exactly
4. When the task creates a PR, build the `--body` from the canonical five-section skeleton above (Summary / Changes / Testing / Scope & Risk / Checklist), because `--body` bypasses the GitHub template file

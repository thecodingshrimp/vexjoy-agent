// fan-out-workflow.js
//
// Generic, parameterized native fan-out/synthesize Workflow. This is the
// default deterministic-runtime executor for Complex / tier-4 work that has NO
// named pipeline (a `pick=null` complexity-trigger from /do Phase 4 Step 1b).
// Unlike comprehensive-review-workflow.js (a STATIC Wave-1 roster + dynamic
// tail), this workflow's roster is supplied ENTIRELY by the caller — there are
// no fixed agent/skill literals in source. The prose `dispatching-parallel-
// agents` flow is the always-safe floor when the Workflow tool is absent.
//
// Runtime contract (see ../../../dynamic-workflows-vs-vexjoy-diff.md):
//   - meta is a pure object literal (name + description + contract) parsed
//     before the body.
//   - parallel(thunks) is a hard barrier; a failed agent resolves to null.
//   - agent({prompt, schema, model, agentType}) forces a StructuredOutput tool
//     call, validates against schema at the tool layer, and returns a typed
//     object — no markdown re-parse, no disk read.
//   - budget.remaining() returns run-wide tokens left; agent() throws when
//     exhausted. The synthesize pass is budget-aware (no unbounded loop).
//   - Wall-clock and randomness are unavailable by design (determinism is
//     bit-stable across replay). This script uses neither.

  //     directive derived from a roster variable AND dispatches agentType from a

## Operator Context Structure

An agent `.md` file is a system-prompt contract. The body after frontmatter must contain these sections in order:

```
1. Role statement (1 paragraph)
2. Expertise list (bullet list: concrete capabilities, not "you are an expert in X")
3. Mandatory pre-action protocol (what to read first and why)
4. Operator context block (hardcoded / default / optional behaviors)
5. Capabilities and limitations table (CAN / CANNOT)
6. Reference loading table (required when references/ exists)
7. Workflow (phase-by-phase with gates)
8. Error handling (cause/solution pairs)
9. Preferred patterns (positive framing)
10. Anti-rationalization table
```

### Operator Context Block

The three-tier behavior model maps directly to how the agent is configured:

| Tier | Label | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Always enforced | **Hardcoded** | Cannot be disabled. Include with WHY clause. |
| On by default | **Default (ON unless disabled)** | Active unless the user turns them off. |
| Off by default | **Optional (OFF unless enabled)** | Inactive unless the user explicitly enables. |

Example entry with WHY clause:

```markdown
### Hardcoded Behaviors (Always Apply)

- **Philosophy-First Editing**: Every modification must be defensible against
  `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`. If an edit violates a principle, reject or restructure.
  WHY: Edits that drift from the philosophy create technical debt that compounds.
```

WHY clauses are mandatory for hardcoded behaviors — they enable the agent to apply the constraint to novel situations not covered by the literal text.

## Reference Loading Table Format

Required in every agent that has a `references/` directory. Format:

```markdown
## Reference Loading Table

| Signal | Load These Files | Why |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| signal phrase matching task context | `references/file-name.md` | One sentence: what the file adds |
```

**Signal design rules:**

- Signals are phrases or keywords that appear in the user's request or the task context
- Each signal must map to exactly one or two reference files (progressive disclosure)
- Signals overlap is acceptable — load greedily when multiple match
- The Why column states what the file adds, not what it contains

**Example:**

```markdown
| Signal | Load These Files | Why |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| frontmatter, YAML, allowed-tools, field compliance | `references/frontmatter-compliance.md` | Required fields, ADR-063 tool restrictions, detection commands |
| routing, triggers, pairs_with, INDEX.json | `references/routing-table-patterns.md` | Phantom route detection, trigger conflict checks |
```

---

## Phase/Gate Pattern

Phases advance sequentially. Each phase ends with a deterministic gate that must pass before the next phase begins.

```markdown
## Phase N — NAME

[Instructions for this phase]

Gate N: [Deterministic check the LLM or a script runs. Expressed as a command or a boolean condition.]
```

**Gate design rules:**

- Gates must be checkable — not advisory opinions
- Script-based gates (commands with exit codes) are stronger than prose conditions
- Gates reference artifacts produced in the current phase, not future phases
- A failing gate names the exact repair action

**Example gate:**

```markdown
Gate 2: YAML frontmatter parses cleanly:
```bash
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('agents/{name}.md').read().split('---')[1]); print('OK')"
```
```

---

## Routing Design

### Trigger Phrase Rules

| Rule | Correct | Wrong |
|------|---------|-------|
| Natural speech | `create agent`, `scaffold agent` | `agent-creation-invocation` |
| Specific enough | `edit skill frontmatter` | `edit`, `update`, `fix` |
| Not generic verbs | `audit hook configuration` | `check`, `manage`, `run` |
| 3–6 triggers per agent | 4 triggers | 1 trigger (under-routing) or 10 (over-claiming) |

### Trigger Conflict Prevention

Before adding triggers, detect conflicts:

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml, glob
from collections import defaultdict
triggers = defaultdict(list)
for f in glob.glob('agents/*.md'):
    txt = open(f).read()
    if '---' not in txt: continue
    try:
        fm = yaml.safe_load(txt.split('---')[1])
        for t in fm.get('routing', {}).get('triggers', []):
            triggers[t.lower()].append(f)
    except: pass
for t, files in triggers.items():
    if len(files) > 1:
        print(f'CONFLICT: \"{t}\" in {files}')
"
```

### pairs_with Design

`pairs_with` lists agents commonly co-dispatched — not all possible collaborators. Rules:

1. List 2–4 agents maximum
2. Each entry must exist on disk before committing
3. An agent cannot list itself
4. Verify existence before adding:

```bash
for name in agent1 agent2; do
  ls agents/${name}.md 2>/dev/null || ls skills/${name}/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING: ${name}"
done
```

## Allowed-Tools Role Mapping (ADR-063)

| Role | Permitted Tools | Rationale |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Reviewer / auditor | `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Read-only: prevents unauthorized changes during review |
| Code modifier / engineer | `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Full access for implementation |
| Orchestrator / coordinator | `Read`, `Agent`, `Bash` | Dispatches agents; no direct file edits |
| Skill-invoker | `Read`, `Bash`, `Glob`, `Grep` | Executes skills but does not write files |

**The rule**: `allowed-tools` must match the agent's actual role. Granting `Edit` to a reviewer lets it make unauthorized changes. Granting `Agent` to a non-orchestrator creates an uncontrolled dispatch path.

Detection — find reviewers with write tools:

```bash
grep -l "reviewer" agents/*.md | xargs grep -l "Edit\|Write"
```

---

## Hook Design

Hooks fire on harness events and enforce gates the model cannot rationalize past. They use exit codes:

| Exit code | Meaning | Use for |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `0` | Pass / advisory | Warnings, informational output, non-blocking nudges |
| `2` | Block | Hard gates: prerequisite missing, policy violation |

**Event types and their purpose:**

| Event | Fires when | Typical gates |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| `SessionStart` | Session opens | Inject learned context, detect operator mode |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User sends a message | Detect pipeline requests, capture corrections |
| `PreToolUse` | Before any tool call | Safety gates, ADR checks, branch safety |
| `PostToolUse` | After any tool call | Quality checks, INDEX sync, framing validation |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | Archive session learnings |
| `Stop` | Session ends | Record metrics, graduate learnings |

**Hook safety rule**: Hooks that enforce advisory policies exit 0. Hooks that enforce hard gates exit 2. A hook that exits non-zero on every call will deadlock the agent loop.

Hook timeout: set `timeout` to the minimum needed. Advisory hooks: 2000–3000ms. Hooks with subprocess calls: 5000ms max.

## Progressive Disclosure Economics

The three-file budget for a well-designed agent:

| File | Role | Size target |
|------|------|-------------|
| `agents/{name}.md` | System prompt — loaded on every dispatch | < 600 lines |
| `{name}/references/*.md` | Deep context — loaded on demand per phase | ≤ 500 lines each |
| `{name}/SPEC.md` | Contract — loaded when designing or modifying | No limit |

**What belongs in the main file**: role statement, frontmatter, phase structure, gate commands, error handling, reference loading table.

**What belongs in references/**: checklists, pattern catalogs, example collections, detection command sets, template prose, anything only needed at execution time.

**Test**: Remove the reference file. Does the agent still work for simple requests? (Yes.) Remove the reference loading table. Can the agent find deep content? (No.) The table is load-bearing; the reference body is not loaded until it's needed.

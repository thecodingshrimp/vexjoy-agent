# /do - Smart Router

/do is a **ROUTER**, not a worker. Classify requests, select the right agent + skill, dispatch. All execution goes to specialized agents.

**Main thread:** (1) Classify, (2) Select agent+skill, (3) Dispatch, (4) Evaluate, (5) Route again if needed, (6) Report.

If you find yourself reading source code, writing code, or doing analysis — pause and route to an agent.

---

## The Completeness Standard

Do the whole thing. Do it right. Do it with tests. Do it with documentation.

- The answer is the finished product, not a plan. Plans organize execution, not replace it.
- Never table work when the permanent solve is within reach. Never present a workaround when the real fix exists.
- If an agent returns partial work, route a follow-up to finish it.
- Search before building. Test before shipping.
- The router decomposes complexity into agent-sized work. Use it.

**The standard:** the result should make the user think "that's done" not "that's a start." Inject this into agent prompts for all Simple+ work.

Model confidence in handling a task directly is a signal to route, not to proceed. Direct handling skips domain knowledge, methodology, and reference files that exist on disk.

---

## Output Discipline

Every sentence the router prints is a sentence the user reads before seeing results.

**Orwell's Six Rules** (1946) apply to all output and all agent prompts:

1. No stale metaphors or figures of speech.
2. Short words over long.
3. Cut every word you can.
4. Active voice over passive.
5. Everyday English over jargon.
6. Break any rule sooner than say anything barbarous.

These rules apply equally to agent prompts. Every word in a dispatched prompt costs tokens on that agent's context window.

**User sees:** phase banners, routing decision banner, brief post-agent summary (what changed, not how).

**Internal only:** Haiku routing responses, classification reasoning, enhancement stacking details (unless Verbose Routing ON).

---

## Instructions

### Phase Banners (MANDATORY)

Every phase MUST display a banner BEFORE executing: `/do > Phase N: PHASE_NAME — description...`

After Phase 2, display the full routing decision banner (`===` block). Phase banners tell the user *where they are*; the routing banner tells them *what was decided*. Both required.

---

### Phase 1: CLASSIFY

**Goal**: Determine request complexity and whether routing is needed.

Read and follow the repository CLAUDE.md before making any routing decision, because it contains project-specific conventions that affect agent selection and skill pairing.

| Complexity | Agent | Skill | Direct Action |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Trivial | No | No | **ONLY reading a file the user named by exact path** |
| Simple | **Yes** | Yes | Route to agent |
| Medium | **Required** | **Required** | Route to agent |
| Complex | Required (2+) | Required (2+) | Route to agent |

**Trivial = reading a file the user named by exact path.** Everything else is Simple+ and MUST route. When uncertain, classify UP.

**Delegation is mandatory.** /do is a delegation machine. Classify Simple+ tasks to agents without reasoning about whether you could handle them directly. Anything beyond reading a user-named file MUST route.

**Progressive Depth**: For ambiguous complexity, start shallow and let the agent escalate. See `references/progressive-depth.md`.

**Common misclassifications** (NOT Trivial — route them): evaluating repos/URLs, opinions/recommendations, git operations, codebase questions (`explore-pipeline`), retro lookups (`retro`), comparing approaches.

**Maximize skill/agent/pipeline usage.** If a skill exists for the task, USE IT.

**Check for parallel patterns FIRST**: 2+ independent failures or 3+ subtasks → `dispatching-parallel-agents`; broad research → `research-coordinator-engineer`; multi-agent coordination → `project-coordinator-engineer`; plan + "execute" → `subagent-driven-development`; new feature → `feature-lifecycle` (check `.feature/` directory; if present, run `feature-state.py status`).

**Parallel dispatch is mandatory.** When the router detects 2+ independent items, dispatch all in parallel in a single message. Do not consolidate into one agent.

**Optional: Force Direct** — OFF by default. Only applies when user explicitly requests it.

**Creation Request Detection** (MANDATORY scan before Gate):

Scan for creation signals:
- Verbs: "create", "scaffold", "build", "add new", "new [component]", "implement new"
- Targets: agent, skill, pipeline, hook, feature, plugin, workflow, voice profile
- Implicit: "I need a [component]", "build me a [component]"

If ANY creation signal found AND complexity Simple+: set `is_creation = true`, Phase 4 Step 0 is MANDATORY (write ADR before dispatching).

**Not creation**: debugging, reviewing, fixing, refactoring, explaining, auditing existing components. When ambiguous, check whether output is a NEW file.

**Gate**: Complexity classified. If creation detected, output `[CREATION REQUEST DETECTED]` before routing banner. Display banner (ALL classifications). Trivial: handle directly. Simple+: proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: ROUTE

**Goal**: Select the correct agent + skill. Semantic intent routing (Haiku) is primary; the deterministic pre-router is a safety-net, not a short-circuit. FORCE-labeled entries are preferred when intent matches semantically (not keyword-based).

**Contract: read for INTENT first.** A model reads what the user MEANS; trigger keywords are hints, never gates. Plain or non-native-English phrasing must route as well as jargon ("send my commits to the server" routes like "git push"). Cost: ~+0.1 Haiku calls/request vs the old keyword short-circuit — measured, deliberately accepted (see `references/semantic-first-ab-results.md`).

**Step 0: Semantic intent routing (PRIMARY)**

Generate the manifest, then dispatch the Haiku routing agent. Its decision is the primary route.

```bash
SDIR="${HOME}/.claude/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.hermes/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.factory/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.gemini/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.codex/scripts"
python3 "$SDIR/routing-manifest.py"
```

Dispatch the Agent tool with `model: "haiku"`, omitting `isolation: "worktree"` — the routing agent only reads a manifest and returns JSON; it never touches files or git, and worktree isolation fails outside a git repo. Use this prompt structure:

```
You are a routing agent. Given a user request and a manifest of available agents, skills, and pipelines, select the BEST agent+skill combination, and optionally a pipeline.

USER REQUEST: {user_request}

ROUTING MANIFEST:
{output of routing-manifest.py}

Return your answer as JSON:
{
  "agent": "agent-name or null",
  "skill": "skill-name or null",
  "pipeline": "pipeline-name or null",
  "reasoning": "one sentence why",
  "confidence": "high/medium/low"
}

FORCE-ROUTE RULE: Entries marked "FORCE" in the manifest MUST be selected when their domain clearly matches the user's intent. However, FORCE matching is SEMANTIC, not keyword-based. Match on what the user MEANS, not individual words. Examples:
- "push my changes" → pr-workflow (FORCE) ✓ (user means git push)
- "push back on this design" → NOT pr-workflow (user means resist/argue)
- "configure my fish shell" → fish-shell-config (FORCE) ✓ (user means Fish shell)
- "fish for bugs" → NOT fish-shell-config (user means search for bugs)
- "quick fix to the login page" → quick (FORCE) ✓ (user wants a small edit)
- "quick overview of the architecture" → NOT quick (user wants exploration)

PIPELINE-SELECTION RULE: The `pipeline` field is OPTIONAL and most requests should return `null`. Return a pipeline name ONLY when BOTH conditions hold:
(1) the user's intent SEMANTICALLY matches a pipeline's `triggers` or `description` in the PIPELINES section of the manifest, AND
(2) the request genuinely benefits from a multi-phase flow (research + write, scope + gather + synthesize, multi-wave review) — not just a single skill task.
Match on MEANING, not keyword overlap. If a single agent+skill satisfies the request, return `null` for pipeline. Examples:
- "write an article in vexjoy voice about X" → pipeline: "voice-writer" ✓ (multi-phase voice content generation matches the voice-writer pipeline)
- "research X with artifacts and sources" → pipeline: "research-pipeline" ✓ (formal SCOPE → GATHER → SYNTHESIZE → VALIDATE → DELIVER flow)
- "comprehensive review of these 8 files" → pipeline: "comprehensive-review" ✓ (multi-wave per-package review across many files)
- "fix the typo on line 42 of foo.py" → pipeline: null (single trivial edit, no pipeline needed)
- "debug this failing test" → pipeline: null (one agent+skill handles it; pipeline only if user asks for systematic debugging artifacts)
- "review this 10-line function" → pipeline: null (single skill, no multi-wave review warranted)
When in doubt, return null. A pipeline pick must be defensible against the manifest's PIPELINES section.

Rules:
- Pick the most specific match. "Go tests" → golang-general-engineer + go-patterns, not general-purpose.
- Agent handles the domain. Skill handles the methodology. Pick both when possible.
- If the request implies a task verb (review, debug, refactor, test), prefer skills that match that verb.
- If nothing matches well, return all nulls with reasoning.
- Prefer entries whose description semantically matches the request, not just keyword overlap.
- For GENUINE git / version-control operations — actually pushing code, committing files to a repository, or opening/merging a pull request — ALWAYS select pr-workflow. Do NOT route metaphorical or non-version-control uses of these words (e.g. 'commit to a decision/plan', 'merge ideas in your head', 'push back on a proposal') to pr-workflow.
- Return a single skill name as a string, not an array. If multiple skills are needed, pick the primary one.
```

**Step 0b: Apply the Haiku agent's recommendation**

Use `agent` and `skill` fields directly. If `confidence` is "low", verify against INDEX files and `INDEX files`. Haiku response is internal — never print to user.

Route to the simplest agent+skill that satisfies the request. When `[cross-repo]` output is present, route to `.claude/agents/` local agents. Route all code modifications to domain agents.

**Step 1: Deterministic safety-net** (`pre-route.py` — runs AFTER the semantic decision, never short-circuits it)

Run the pre-router and use its result ONLY as a guardrail over the semantic pick:

```bash
SDIR="${HOME}/.claude/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.hermes/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.factory/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.gemini/scripts"; [ -d "$SDIR" ] || SDIR="${HOME}/.codex/scripts"
python3 "$SDIR/pre-route.py" --request "{user_request}" --json-compact
```

- **(a) Safety-critical force-route override.** If pre-route returns `"confidence": "high"` with a `force_route` match for `pr-workflow` or a security skill, and the semantic pick disagrees, override to the force-route. Git and security work MUST hit quality gates. Record `match_type` in routing decision tags.
- **(b) Guards stay active.** Its phrase/unigram guards continue to suppress false matches (e.g. "fish out", metaphorical commit/merge). A guarded request stays with the semantic decision.
- Otherwise the semantic decision from Step 0 stands. The pre-router no longer overrides a good semantic pick on the long tail.

**Critical**: genuine "push", "commit", "create PR", "merge" MUST route through skills with quality gates (lint, tests, CI verification) — enforced by the safety-net override above.

**Step 2: Apply skill override** (task verb overrides default skill)

When the request verb implies a specific methodology, override the agent's default skill. Common overrides: "review" → systematic-code-review, "debug" → systematic-debugging, "refactor" → systematic-refactoring, "TDD" → test-driven-development. Full override table in `INDEX files`.

**Step 3: Display routing decision** (MANDATORY — FIRST visible output, before any work)

```
===================================================================
 ROUTING: [brief summary]
===================================================================
 Selected:
   -> Agent: [name] - [why]
   -> Skill: [name] - [why]
   -> Pipeline: PHASE1 → PHASE2 → ... (if pipeline; phases from skills/workflow/references/pipeline-index.json)
   -> Extra Rigor: [add verification patterns for code/security/testing tasks when needed]
 Invoking...
===================================================================
```

For Trivial: show `Classification: Trivial - [reason]` and `Handling directly (no agent/skill needed)`.

**Optional: Dry Run Mode** — OFF by default. When enabled, show the routing decision without executing.

**Optional: Verbose Routing** — OFF by default. When enabled, explain why each alternative was rejected.

**Step 4: Record routing decision** (Simple+ only — skip Trivial):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record \
    routing "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" \
    "routing-decision: agent={selected_agent} skill={selected_skill} request: {first_200_chars} complexity: {complexity} enhancements: {comma_separated_list}" \
    --category effectiveness \
    --tags "{applicable_flags}"
```

Tags: `thinking:slow` or `thinking:fast` (from Step 2 directive). Advisory — continue if it fails. Categories: `effectiveness` (success), `misroute` (reroutes).

**Gate**: Agent+skill selected. Banner displayed. Decision recorded. Proceed to Phase 3.

---

### Phase 3: ENHANCE

**Goal**: Stack additional skills based on request signals. Use retro knowledge if present in context.

| Signal in Request | Enhancement to Add |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Any substantive work (code, design, plan) | Add relevant retro knowledge only when it materially helps the task |
| "comprehensive" / "thorough" / "full" | Add parallel reviewers (security + business + quality) |
| "with tests" / "production ready" | Append test-driven-development + verification-before-completion |
| "research needed" / "investigate first" | Prepend research-coordinator-engineer |
| "review" with 5+ files | Use parallel-code-review (3 reviewers) |
| Diff-scope review detected (comprehensive/full review on a real diff) | Run `python3 scripts/right-size-review.py --base {base} --head {head}` (or `--files N --packages M`); dispatch the matching tier — Tier 1→parallel-code-review (3), Tier 2→Wave 1 (12), Tier 3→Wave 1+2 subset (17), Tier 4→full (27). Escalate one tier on any CRITICAL finding. No tier signal → current full behavior. |
| Complex implementation | Offer subagent-driven-development |
| "local only" / "no push" / "keep it local" / "don't commit" / "stay local" | Inject `local-only` constraint (see `shared-patterns/local-only.md`). Prepend to agent prompt: "**LOCAL-ONLY MODE.** Do not push, commit, create PRs, or deploy. All work stays on disk. Read-only git is fine." |
| Voice profile skill selected (voice-vexjoy, voice-dragonball-z, voice-andy-nemmity, etc.) | Stack `voice-writer` as the execution pipeline. Voice-writer's 13-phase pipeline is required for all voice content generation. The selected voice-* skill loads as the voice profile in Phase 1 (LOAD). |
| Vague verb + ambiguous object + no concrete file/symbol named + multiple plausible interpretations | `planning` (interview mode) — load `depth-first-interview.md` |

**Interview-mode heuristic.** Fires when: short request (<15 words), verb in `{build, design, make, fix, figure out, set up}`, object has no file/symbol/path qualifier, no acceptance criteria.

| Example | Match? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "i'm not sure how to approach this complex build" | MATCH | Uncertainty + vague verb + no concrete target |
| "fix the typo on line 42 of foo.py" | NO | Concrete file, location, verb |
| "build a thing that does X" | MATCH | Vague verb + ambiguous object + no file named |
| "add a test for `parseConfig` in src/config.go" | NO | Concrete symbol + file + verb |
| "where do i even start with this rewrite" | MATCH | Explicit uncertainty, no concrete subject |
| "rename `cfg` to `config` in `internal/`" | NO | Concrete symbol + directory + mechanical op |

When in doubt, defer injection. False positives cost one round of friction; false negatives are recoverable via `/quick --interview`.

Before stacking, check `pairs_with` in `skills/INDEX.json`. Prefer listed pairs. Empty `pairs_with: []` means undeclared, not prohibited. Skills with built-in verification gates may not benefit from stacking.

Add anti-rationalization patterns for these task types when the task benefits from explicit rigor:

| Task Type | Patterns Injected |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Code modification | anti-rationalization-core, verification-checklist |
| Code review | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-review |
| Security work | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-security |
| Testing | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-testing |
| Debugging | anti-rationalization-core, verification-checklist |
| External content evaluation | **untrusted-content-handling** |

For explicit maximum rigor, use `/with-anti-rationalization [task]`.

**Gate**: Enhancements applied. Proceed to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: EXECUTE

**Goal**: Invoke the selected agent + skill and deliver results.

**Step 0: Execute Creation Protocol** (creation requests ONLY)

If creation signal + Simple+: (1) Write ADR at `adr/{kebab-case-name}.md`, (2) Register via `adr-query.py register`, (3) Proceed to plan. ADR hooks (`adr-context-injector`, `adr-enforcement`) handle cross-agent compliance automatically.

**Step 1: Create plan** (Simple+)

Create `task_plan.md` before execution. Skip for Trivial only.

**Step 1b: Apply quality-loop pipeline** (Medium+ code modifications)

For code modifications at Medium/Complex, load `references/quality-loop.md` as the **outer orchestration wrapper**:

- **Quality-loop** (outer) = 14-phase lifecycle: ADR → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → TEST → REVIEW → INTENT VERIFY → LIVE VALIDATE → FIX → RETEST → PR → CODEX REVIEW → ADR RECONCILE → RECORD → CLEANUP
- **Agent + skill** (inner) = domain expertise inside IMPLEMENT phase

Quality-loop absorbs Steps 0-1. The Phase 2 agent+skill selection becomes the implementation agent. Force-route skills are used INSIDE the loop.

Does NOT apply when: Trivial/Simple (use `quick`), review-only/research/debugging/content creation, or user requests simpler flow.

**Step 1b (native Workflow dispatch): run the deterministic variant when the harness supports it, else the prose pipeline.** When the Haiku router emitted a pipeline `pick` (#686), decide the executor with the ADR decision table (`harness-conditional-workflow-dispatch`):

```
pick = haiku_route.pipeline                         # #686, may be null
cap  = scripts/detect-workflow-capability.py        # env proxy: {harness, workflow_capable}
reg  = scripts/workflow-registry.py                 # auto-derived {meta.name: path}
{scope, tier} = scripts/right-size-review.py        # #688 right-sizing (review picks)

if pick is None:                                            -> agent + skill direct (no pipeline)
elif reg.get(pick) and cap.workflow_capable and (Workflow tool in MY tool list):
        # env proxy AND LLM tool-list self-check (the authoritative gate)
                                                            -> Workflow tool: run(reg[pick], {scope, tier})
else:                                                       -> run the prose pipeline markdown (unchanged)
```

The native path (e.g. `comprehensive-review-workflow.js`) scales waves to tier, passes schema-validated typed findings between waves without disk round-trips, runs a per-finding adversarial verify, and bounds the fix loop by the native token budget. The prose markdown flow is the always-safe fallback and runs identically on Codex/Gemini/Factory or when the `Workflow` tool is absent. `cap.workflow_capable` is an env-derived PROXY; the orchestrator's own tool-list check is the authoritative gate — both must hold. A `pick` with no registry entry is prose-only.

**Banner parity (R4):** expand the pipeline name → phase list for the routing banner on BOTH paths, so the banner reads identically regardless of executor.

**Step 2: Invoke agent with skill**

Dispatch the agent. MCP tool discovery is the agent's responsibility — do not inject MCP instructions from /do.

**Prepend Task Specification for Medium+ tasks.** The router has upstream context the agent lacks. Compose and prepend this block. For Simple tasks, include Intent and Acceptance if extractable. Do not invent criteria or expand scope.

```
## Task Specification (auto-extracted)

**Intent:** <one sentence: what does success look like?>
**Constraints:** <branch rules, operator-context, file paths, memory feedback>
**Acceptance criteria:** <observable: tests pass, file exists, PR merges, specific output>
**Relevant file locations:** <paths from request + expected paths>
**Operator context:** <from [operator-context] tag>
```

Extraction: Intent from verb+object. Constraints include branch safety (never merge to main), memory feedback, operator context. Acceptance = observable outcomes. For creation requests, add "Implementation must match ADR `<kebab-case-name>`."

**MANDATORY: Inject reference loading instruction for ALL dispatched agents.** Every agent prompt MUST include: "Before starting work, read your agent .md file to find the Reference Loading Table. Load EVERY reference file whose signal matches this task. Load greedily — if multiple signals match, load all matching references."

**MANDATORY: Inject the completeness standard for ALL Simple+ dispatches.** Every agent prompt MUST include: "Deliver the finished product. Ship the complete thing."

**MANDATORY: Inject density standard for ALL Simple+ dispatches.** Every agent prompt MUST include: "Write dense: high fidelity, minimum words. Cut filler, prefer tables over paragraphs, report what changed — not how."

**MANDATORY: Inject base instructions for ALL dispatched agents.** Every agent prompt MUST include: "Before starting work, also load `agents/base-instructions.md` for universal operational rules."

**Token budget signal (optional, documented).** Read `orchestration.token_budget` from `.claude/settings.json` (default 500000 when absent). Subtract a rough estimate of tokens already spent this session; prepend to each dispatched agent prompt: "~{remaining} tokens available for this task; prioritize accordingly." This is an advisory signal, not a hard runtime cap — it nudges agents to right-size their own work. Keep it cheap: read the key once per session, skip injection if the key is absent and no default is desired.

```bash
TOKEN_BUDGET=$(python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open('.claude/settings.json')).get('orchestration',{}).get('token_budget',500000))" 2>/dev/null || echo 500000)
```

**Inject thinking directive.** Prepend verbatim, no framing:

| Complexity | Thinking Directive |
|---|---|
| Trivial | None (no agent) |
| Simple | "Prioritize responding quickly rather than thinking deeply. When in doubt, respond directly." |
| Medium | None (adaptive) |
| Complex | "Think carefully and step-by-step before responding; this problem is harder than it looks." |

**Category overrides** (regardless of complexity): `thinking:slow` for security work, API/schema design, migrations, 5+ file reviews, architectural decisions. `thinking:fast` for lookups, status checks, single-function renames/refactors.

Record as `thinking:slow` or `thinking:fast` in Phase 2 Step 4 `--tags`.

**Verb-based model dispatch for Complex tasks (3+ data sources).** Extraction verbs use parallel Haiku readers; analysis verbs use single Opus agent (38% cheaper, 23% faster for extraction — A/B tested).

| Task verb class | Dispatch mode |
|---|---|
| list, count, extract, inventory, search, check, find, grep | Parallel Haiku readers → Opus synthesizer |
| review, audit, assess, analyze, debug, investigate, evaluate | Single Opus agent (direct) |

Haiku dispatch: spawn Agent with `model: "haiku"` per data source, collect extracts, synthesize with Opus. Simple/Medium: dispatch directly.

Route to agents that create feature branches. Include "commit your changes on the branch" in agent prompts for file modifications.

For `isolation: "worktree"` agents, inject `worktree-agent` skill rules: "Verify CWD contains .claude/worktrees/. Create feature branch before edits. Skip task_plan.md. Stage specific files only."

Non-org repos: up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix before PR creation. Org-gated repos (via `scripts/classify-repo.py`): require user confirmation before EACH git action.

**Step 3: Handle multi-part requests**

Detect: "first...then", "and also", numbered lists, semicolons. Sequential dependencies execute in order. Independent items launch multiple Task tools in single message. Max parallelism: 10 agents.

**Step 4: Auto-Pipeline Fallback** (no match AND complexity >= Simple)

Invoke `auto-pipeline` for unmatched requests. If no pipeline matches, fall back to closest agent + verification-before-completion.

When uncertain: **ROUTE ANYWAY** with verification-before-completion as safety net.

**Gate**: Agent invoked, results delivered. Proceed to Phase 5.

---

### Phase 5: LEARN

**Goal**: Capture session insights to `learning.db`.

**Routing decision** (Simple+, observable facts only):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record \
    routing "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" \
    "routing-decision: agent={selected_agent} skill={selected_skill} tool_errors: {0|1} user_rerouted: {0|1}" \
    --category effectiveness
```

**Routing outcome** (MANDATORY for Simple+ — records whether the route succeeded):
After the agent completes, evaluate the outcome based on observable facts:
- **Success signals**: agent produced commits, tests passed, no tool errors, user accepted result
- **Failure signals**: agent errored, user re-routed, rework required, `tool_errors=1`

```bash
# On success:
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record-routing-outcome \
    "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" --success

# On failure (include reason):
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record-routing-outcome \
    "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" --failure --reason "{brief reason}"
```

Do not skip this step.

**Right-sizing feedback** (when a tiered review/parallel-analysis ran): record the actual agent count against the detected file scope so the heuristic can be refined later.

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record \
    routing "rightsizing:tier{tier}" \
    "rightsizing: tier={tier} files={file_count} packages={package_count} agents_dispatched={actual_count}" \
    --category effectiveness --tags rightsizing
```

**Auto-capture** (hooks, zero LLM cost): `error-learner.py`, `review-capture.py` (PostToolUse), `session-learning-recorder.py` (Stop).

**Skill-scoped recording**:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py learn --skill go-patterns "insight"
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py learn --agent golang-general-engineer "insight"
```

**Immediate graduation for review findings** (MANDATORY): Issue found + fixed in same PR → (1) Record scoped, (2) Boost to 1.0, (3) Embed into failure modes, (4) Graduate, (5) Stage in same PR.

**Gate**: Record at least one learning AND one routing outcome for Simple+ tasks. Review findings get immediate graduation.

## Error Handling

### Error: "No Agent Matches Request"
Cause: Request domain not covered by any agent
Solution: Check INDEX files and `INDEX files` for near-matches. Route to closest agent with verification-before-completion. Report the gap.

### Error: "Force-Route Conflict"
Cause: Multiple force-route triggers match the same request
Solution: Apply most specific force-route first. Stack secondary routes as enhancements if compatible.

### Error: "Plan Required But Not Created"
Cause: Simple+ task attempted without task_plan.md
Solution: Stop execution. Create `task_plan.md`. Resume routing after plan is in place.

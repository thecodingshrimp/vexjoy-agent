## Repos

### BugRoger/beastmode
https://github.com/BugRoger/beastmode

Referenced as prior art for the retro knowledge system. Our implementation has diverged significantly from this approach.

**Patterns noted:**
- Original inspiration for session-level learning and knowledge accumulation concepts
- Our implementation (SQLite + FTS5, confidence scoring, graduation pipeline) bears little resemblance to the current state of beastmode

### caliber-ai-org/ai-setup
https://github.com/caliber-ai-org/ai-setup

TypeScript CLI that fingerprints projects and generates AI configs for Claude, Cursor, Codex, and GitHub Copilot. Studied for its deterministic scoring system, learning ROI tracking, and multi-platform writer abstraction.

**Patterns adopted:**
- Deterministic component scoring without LLM calls (ADR-031). Their 6-dimension scoring rubric for config quality proved that mechanical validation catches a class of errors LLM evaluation misses entirely.
- Learning staleness detection (ADR-033). Flagging learnings with zero activations over N sessions as prune candidates.
- PID-based lockfile with staleness detection (ADR-035). Their concurrent access pattern for preventing data corruption in shared files.
- Score regression guard concept (ADR-034). Comparing quality before and after changes, auto-reverting if score drops.

**Patterns noted but not adopted:**
- Token budget scoring (penalizing configs over 2000 tokens). Conflicts with our high-context agent philosophy.
- Multi-platform config generation (Claude + Cursor + Codex writers). We're Claude Code focused.
- Session event JSONL format for learning capture. Our SQLite + FTS5 approach serves better for search and graduation.

### alchaincyf/nuwa-skill
https://github.com/alchaincyf/nuwa-skill

Single-skill Claude Code repository that distills public figures into runnable voice/cognition skills. Studied during the voice-cloner upgrade for its extraction discipline and deterministic phase gating.

**Patterns adopted:**
- Triple-validation extraction rubric (recurrence + generative power + exclusivity). A pattern is kept only if it appears across ≥2 distinct sources, predicts new behavior the source has not yet produced, and distinguishes the subject from peers in the same category. Wired into our `create-voice` Step 3 (PATTERN) and Step 4 (RULE) gates via `skills/content/create-voice/references/extraction-validation.md`. Codified at the philosophy layer in the "Triple-Validation Extraction Gate" section of `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`.
- Deterministic phase checkpoints. Their Phase-1.5 stats-table-as-gate pattern between research-gathering and synthesis became `scripts/research-stats-checkpoint.py`, wired into `voice-writer` Phase 2.5. Codified as the "Deterministic Phase Checkpoints" section of `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`.

**Patterns noted but not adopted:**
- Mandatory "honest limits" output block declaring what the produced skill cannot do. Conflicts with our positive-instruction framing — we rely on the verifier loop to surface failures rather than asking output to declare its own limits.
- Persona-impersonation template that rewrites the produced skill into first-person "I" voice. Out of scope for our voice-cloner, which keeps profile and content separated.
- Required attribution footer in every generated skill. We attribute in this file; produced artifacts stay clean.
- `npx skills add` distribution layer. Orthogonal to our flat `~/.claude/skills/` model.

### Trystan-SA/claude-design-system-prompt
https://github.com/Trystan-SA/claude-design-system-prompt

Design-oriented system prompt with 14 procedural design skills for Claude Code. Studied for its design-specific quality patterns and UI review methodologies.

**Patterns adopted:**
- AI slop detection checklist (8 concrete failure modes for AI-generated UI). Rebuilt as `agents/ui-design-engineer/references/ai-slop-detection.md` with positive-instruction-first format and detection commands.
- Interaction state coverage matrix (6-state exhaustive check per interactive element). Rebuilt as `agents/ui-design-engineer/references/interaction-state-coverage.md` with CSS specifics and timing bounds.
- Spacing/type scale enforcement (flag any px value not on a 4px/8px grid). Rebuilt as `scripts/design-scale-check.py` — fully deterministic, zero LLM involvement.
- oklch() color harmony technique (perceptually uniform palette generation). Rebuilt as `skills/frontend/distinctive-frontend-design/references/oklch-color-harmony.md`.
- Honest placeholder pattern (striped backgrounds for missing assets). Rebuilt as `skills/frontend/distinctive-frontend-design/references/honest-placeholders.md`.

**Patterns noted but not adopted:**
- Discovery questions failure mode #4 ("ask only what you lack"). Valuable general principle but already partially encoded in our blocker tables' "skip-if-answered" rules.
- Polish pass umbrella skill (parallel 4-agent design review). Architecturally interesting but we already have the multi-wave review pattern; adding a design-specific umbrella is future work.
- Wireframe discipline conventions (greyscale-only exploration). Valuable if we build design artifact generation workflows; filed for future reference.
- Component gap analysis (near-duplicates, missing states, implied-but-undefined variants). Useful but only relevant when we build component extraction workflows.
- Five-question content filler test. Good rubric but too narrow for a standalone reference; the principle is already embedded in our "one job per section" constraint.

### mattpocock/skills
https://github.com/mattpocock/skills

Focused collection of 12 active Claude Code skills centered on DDD-inspired domain modeling, grilling-based requirement clarification, and "deep module" architecture improvement. Small repo (57 files) with high-quality, opinionated patterns. Studied 2026-05-01.

**Patterns adopted:**
- Architecture deepening vocabulary and methodology. Their `/improve-codebase-architecture` skill's coherent vocabulary (module depth, seams, leverage, locality) and deletion test for finding shallow modules. Rebuilt as `skills/research/architecture-deepening/` skill with 3-phase workflow (EXPLORE, PRESENT CANDIDATES, DESIGN CONVERSATION) and reference files for vocabulary, interface design, and deepening strategies.
- Feedback-loop-first debugging methodology. Their `/diagnose` skill's 10 loop construction methods and "the loop IS the skill" philosophy. Rebuilt as `skills/workflow/references/feedback-loop-construction.md`, integrated into the OBSERVE phase of systematic-debugging.

**Patterns noted but not adopted:**
- Domain glossary convention (CONTEXT.md format). Formalized project-level domain vocabulary. Evaluated and reverted — our agents already carry domain vocabulary in their own files, and the convention solves a problem we don't have.
- Grilling / requirement interviewing (`/grill-me`). Our `planning` skill's `depth-first-interview.md` already provides equivalent decision-tree traversal with ranked branches and max 5 questions.
- Issue triage state machine (`/triage`). Specific to GitHub Issues project management workflows, not aligned with our toolkit's focus.
- Compressed communication mode (`/caveman`). Marginal token savings relative to total session cost. Conflicts with our plain language philosophy.
- Agent briefs format (AGENT-BRIEF.md). Interesting durable behavioral spec for async agents, but we already have task decomposition in our planning skill.
- Out-of-scope knowledge base (`.out-of-scope/` directory). Persistent rejection tracking with reasoning. Interesting pattern but low priority.
- Plugin distribution format (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Orthogonal to our flat `~/.claude/skills/` model.

### notque/consensuscode
https://github.com/notque/consensuscode

The toolkit author's prior agent system, built January 2026 when Claude Code agents first came out (before skills existed). A flat collective of 7 agents coordinating through a file-based consensus protocol.

**Patterns adopted:**
- Multi-agent consultation for architecture decisions (ADR: multi-agent-consultation). Their all-agent consultation model — every significant decision gets input from domain expert, contrarian, and user advocate before implementation proceeds — inspired our `adr-consultation` skill and the 3-lens review pattern.
- File-based inter-agent communication. Agents write structured responses to `adr/{name}/` directories so later agents can read and respond to earlier agents' output. Replaces isolated agent dispatch.
- Concern tracking with resolution gates. Blocking concerns must be resolved before implementation begins. Adapted into the GATE phase of `adr-consultation`.
- Coordinator-as-facilitator, not manager. The consensus-coordinator had zero decision authority — it ensured all agents were consulted, it couldn't override. Reinforced our coordination layer pattern where /do routes but never implements.

**Patterns noted but not adopted:**
- Political philosophy agents (Chomsky, Graeber). Their governance analysis function was adapted into the meta-process lens of `reviewer-perspectives` (system health analysis) without the political framing.
- Full consensus requirement (unanimous agreement). Too heavy for our pace. We use 3-agent consultation with blocking-concern gates instead.
- CollectiveFlow CLI (Go tool for proposal management). Our ADR system + consultation directories serve the same function without a separate tool.

## Blog Posts

### vexjoy.com
https://vexjoy.com

The toolkit author's blog. Posts that crystallized design decisions:

- **Everything That Can Be Deterministic, Should Be** - The four-layer architecture (Router, Agent, Skill, Script) and the division of labor between LLMs and programs.
- **The /do Router** - Specialist selection over generalism. Why keyword-matching routing produces more consistent results than generalist improvisation.
- **The Handyman Principle** - Context as a scarce resource. Why specialized agents beat one giant system prompt.
- **I Was Excited to See Someone Else Build a /do Router** - Convergent evolution in AI tooling and the case for open sharing.

## Original Innovations

Patterns developed through trial and error in this toolkit, not derived from external sources.

### The /do Router and Specialist Selection
Intent-based routing to domain-specific agents. Originally keyword-matching, evolved to intent-based descriptions after deterministic substring routing failed (PR #120). The insight that "which agent has the right mental scaffolding" matters more than "which agent is smartest." Developed over months of observing inconsistent results from generalist prompts.

### Anti-Rationalization as Infrastructure
Auto-injected anti-rationalization tables that make it structurally difficult to skip verification. Not a policy doc that gets ignored. Infrastructure that fires on every code modification, review, and security task. Born from repeated incidents where "should work" turned out to be wrong.

### Learning Graduation Pipeline
Record at 0.7 confidence, boost on validation, graduate into agent/skill markdown, ship together. The insight that review findings should be immediately embedded as permanent behavior changes, not passively recorded for "multiple observations." Developed after noticing that deferred learnings never got acted on.

### Four-Wave Comprehensive Review
26+ specialized reviewer agents in 4 cascading waves: per-package deep review (Wave 0), cross-cutting foundation (Wave 1, 12 agents), context-aware deep-dive (Wave 2, 10 agents), adversarial challenge (Wave 3, 4-5 agents). Each wave's findings enrich the next. Evolved from single-agent reviews that kept missing cross-cutting concerns.

### Pipeline-First Architecture
The principle that any task with 3+ phases should be a pipeline with gates, artifacts, and parallelization. Emerged from observing that ad-hoc execution skips steps under time pressure but pipelines with explicit phase gates don't.

### Two-Tier Evaluation (Deterministic + LLM)
Deterministic scoring (file existence, frontmatter validity, path checking) as a fast, free first pass, with LLM evaluation for nuanced quality. Neither replaces the other. Adopted after analyzing how mechanical failures wasted LLM evaluation tokens.

### Retro Knowledge Injection
SQLite + FTS5 database of operational learnings, auto-injected into relevant agent prompts via hook. Benchmarked at +5.3 avg score improvement, 67% win rate. The cross-session memory that makes each session smarter than the last.

### The Handyman Principle
"Context is a scarce resource, not a dumpster." Specialized agents loaded only when their triggers match, rather than one giant system prompt. Named and articulated through blog writing that forced clarity on why large prompts degrade performance.

### Manifest + Undo for Upgrades
SHA-256 snapshot before modification, backup storage, score regression detection, and rollback capability. Created after an upgrade broke agent references and required manual git archaeology to recover.

## Principles

### Claude Code Documentation
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

Official documentation for hooks, settings.json schema, slash commands, and MCP server configuration. The event-driven hook architecture (PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart) is the foundation for error learning, retro knowledge injection, and auto-plan detection.

"""Detect the running harness from environment variables (env proxy).

Emits JSON: {"harness": "claude-code|codex|gemini|factory|unknown",
             "workflow_capable": bool}

Anthropic's native ``Workflow`` tool (deterministic JS orchestration) is
Claude Code-only. Codex, Gemini, and Factory do not have it; the toolkit's
prose pipelines run everywhere. ``workflow_capable`` is the env-derived proxy
``harness == "claude-code"``.

PROXY, NOT AUTHORITY. A subprocess cannot introspect the session's tool list,
only the environment. So this script answers "which harness am I in?" and the
orchestrator LLM adds the authoritative gate: "is the `Workflow` tool actually
in my tool list?". Both must be true to take the native path. See
adr/harness-conditional-workflow-dispatch.md (R1).

Detection markers (distinctive entrypoint/session/home vars — never generic
API-key vars like GEMINI_API_KEY, which are commonly set under any harness):
  claude-code : CLAUDECODE, CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT, CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
  codex       : CODEX_HOME, CODEX_HOOKS_DIR
  gemini      : GEMINI_CLI
  factory     : FACTORY_SESSION_ID, FACTORY_HOME, DROID_SESSION_ID, DROID_HOME
Mirrors hooks/lib/hook_utils.py:detect_cli(), extended with factory + the
Claude Code session markers.

Pure stdlib. Exit 0 always. Never raises.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/detect-workflow-capability.py            # JSON to stdout
    python3 scripts/detect-workflow-capability.py --harness  # bare harness id

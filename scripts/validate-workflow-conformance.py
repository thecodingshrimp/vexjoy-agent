"""Conformance gate for native .js workflows: declared contract vs actual dispatch.

A native Workflow ``.js`` may declare a pure-literal ``meta.contract`` describing
the dispatch shape it promises:

    contract: {
      phases: ["wave-1", ...],                 // phase() titles entered
      roster: [{agentType, skills:[...]}, ...],// the FIXED (static) Wave-1 barrier
        // OR  roster: { dynamic: true }        // a FULLY-DYNAMIC, caller-supplied roster
      agents: { static: <N>, dynamic: <bool> },// fixed barrier size
      dynamic: <bool>,                          // data-driven passes present?
    }

Each roster entry declares ``skills`` as a LIST (the full /do skill stack the
agent attaches via one ``Skill("..")`` per element). The legacy singular
``skill: "name"`` is accepted as a one-element list. The gate verifies EACH
declared skill has a corresponding ``Skill("..")`` emission.

Two roster shapes are supported:

* STATIC roster (list of ``{agentType, skills:[...]}``): the fixed Wave-1 barrier.
  Each agentType is pinned (SHAPE) and EVERY skill in each entry's list is checked
  (SKILLS); the barrier size is COUNT-checked. This is the comprehensive-review
  shape (static Wave-1 + dynamic tail).
* FULLY-DYNAMIC roster (``roster: {dynamic: true}``): the roster is supplied
  entirely by the caller (e.g. fan-out-workflow), so there are NO static
  agentType:/Skill("..") literals to pin. The gate asserts the STRUCTURAL
  INVARIANT instead — source emits a per-roster ``Skill(`` directive built from a
  variable AND dispatches ``agentType`` from a roster variable — NOT specific
  names, and LABELS the check as STRUCTURAL (no silent vacuous pass).

This script asserts the actual script against that contract, in two layers:

* STATIC (pure stdlib, always runs, the CI gate):
  - ``meta.phases`` (the phase()/enterPhase() titles in source) == ``contract.phases``
  - static roster: every agentType dispatched + every skill resolvable in source;
    ``contract.agents.static`` == ``len(roster)`` and >= that many ``agent(`` call-sites
  - fully-dynamic roster: the STRUCTURAL invariant (Skill(-from-variable +
    agentType-from-variable) is present in source
* DYNAMIC (shells to scripts/conformance-harness.mjs IF node is available):
  - every recorded ``phases_entered`` (per tier) is a subset of ``contract.phases``
  - the recorded static Wave-1 roster (agentType + skills) matches ``contract.roster``
  - for ``dynamic:true`` it asserts SHAPE + SKILLS, NOT COUNT (honest limit) and
    says so in the output.

Honest limits, no silent caps: the STATIC pass COUNT-checks only the fixed Wave-1
barrier (``contract.agents.static``). For ``dynamic:true`` workflows the per-finding
verify pass and the budget-bounded fix loop fan out over RUNTIME data and are NOT
count-checked — only their SHAPE and SKILLS are asserted. Each result records which
checks were COUNT vs SHAPE+SKILLS.

node availability: CI does not provide node (.github/workflows/test.yml uses
setup-python only). When node is absent the DYNAMIC pass is SKIPPED (recorded as a
note), NOT failed — the STATIC pass is the CI gate. The .mjs harness is a documented
local/dev tool. See adr/native-fast-path-portable-floor.md Stages 0-1.

Files WITHOUT a ``meta.contract`` are EXEMPT (prose-only / legacy) — skipped, not
failed.

Pure stdlib. Exit 0 when every contracted file passes (and exempt files are
skipped); exit 1 on any conformance mismatch; exit 2 on a usage error.

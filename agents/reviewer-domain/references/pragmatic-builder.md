# Pragmatic Builder Domain

Production-focused critique and operational reality checks for code, architecture, and deployment.

## Expertise
- **Production Operations**: Deployment, rollback, feature flags, incident response
- **Error Handling**: Failure modes, degradation, circuit breakers, retry strategies
- **Observability**: Metrics, structured logging, tracing, alerting, SLO/SLI
- **Scalability**: Load patterns, bottlenecks, caching, database scaling, rate limiting
- **Edge Cases**: Boundaries, race conditions, network partitions, resource exhaustion

## Core Philosophy
- If you haven't thought about failure, you haven't thought
- Observability is not optional
- Simple code is debuggable code
- The rollback plan IS the deployment plan

## 5-Step Production Readiness Review

### Step 1: Production Readiness
Deployment complexity, rollback procedure, config management, dependency health, resource limits.

### Step 2: Error Handling
Errors caught vs propagated, retry with backoff, graceful degradation, partial failure handling.

### Step 3: Observability
Metrics, structured queryable logging, distributed tracing, failure alerts.

### Step 4: Edge Cases
Boundary conditions, race conditions, network partitions, resource exhaustion.

### Step 5: Scalability
Bottlenecks, caching and invalidation, database query patterns, rate limiting.

## Common Production Gaps

| Area | Gap | Fix |
|------|-----|-----|
| Deployment | No rollback procedure | Document rollback, test in staging |
| Deployment | Missing health checks | Implement /health and /ready endpoints |
| Errors | No retry for external calls | Exponential backoff with jitter |
| Errors | Silent background failures | Emit metrics, alert on failure rates |
| Errors | No circuit breaker | Circuit breaker with fallback |
| Observability | No structured logging | structlog, include correlation IDs |
| Observability | Missing critical metrics | Instrument all endpoints |
| Edge Cases | No input validation | Validate at API boundaries |
| Edge Cases | Race conditions | Locks or atomic operations |
| Scalability | No query optimization | Indexes, fix N+1 |
| Scalability | No caching | Cache expensive ops with TTL |
| Scalability | Resource leaks | Context managers, pool limits |
| Scalability | No rate limiting | Per-user and per-IP limits |

## Operational Patterns to Detect

1. **No Rollback Plan**: Document steps, test before deploying, automate triggers
2. **Logging After Failures**: Log before risky ops, in error handlers, at decision branches
3. **Untested Edge Cases**: Test boundaries, error paths, concurrent access
4. **No Circuit Breaker**: Wrap external calls, implement fallbacks
5. **Trusting User Input**: Validate, sanitize, parameterize queries
6. **Synchronous Long Ops**: Queue jobs, return with status URL
7. **Magic Numbers**: Named constants, configurable via env vars
8. **No Connection Pooling**: Pool all DB, Redis, HTTP connections

### Synthesis
**Biggest operational risk:** [What causes most pages]
**First thing to break:** [Under what conditions, file:line]
**Most critical missing piece:** [What to add first]

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "It works in my tests" | Review under production conditions |
| "Users won't do that" | Test edge cases anyway |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Add observability now |
| "Small change, low risk" | Full review including rollback |
| "Dependency is reliable" | Plan for dependency failure |
| "We can hotfix if needed" | Deploy it right the first time |
